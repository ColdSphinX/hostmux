.Sh DESCRIPTION
Call hostmux followed by a list of hosts you want to connect to via ssh.
The script will create a new tmux session with a split pane for each
specified host and connect to it.
.Pp
You can then use the synchronize-panes feature of tmux to
multiplex/broadcast commands to all split panes / servers
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Specify a name for the tmux session. It defaults to
.Ql hostmux
which means that you can have only one hostmux session at a time if you don't
specify unique names for your sessions
.It Fl l
Specify a valid tmux layout e.g. even-horizontal, tiled, etc. It defaults
to
.Ql even-vertical
.It Fl r
Specify a remote host used to jump to the hosts in a secured environment.
.It Fl x
Close the pane and/or session automatically when the ssh session
session exits successfully.
.It Fl n
Enumerate the sessions so hostmux does not add hosts to a session with the same name.
This is especially usefull if you use hostmux in shell aliases to have easy access to your clusters.
.It Fl h
Display usage information
.It Fl f
Specify a file to read ssh targets from. This can be used in addition to
host specified as arguments on the command line.
.It Ar host
Specify a space separated list of one or more user@hostname ssh targets. This
is what you would pass to the ssh command when you are connecting
to a host. Currently there is no support for passing additional flags
to ssh. If you do need them, add them to your ~/.ssh/config
.El
.Sh HOSTS FILE FORMAT
The hosts file should contain one ssh target per line. The format and
restrictiona sfor ssh targets are identical to those for hosts specified
on the command line.
